# Equator

Equator is a tool to generate questions to test your knowledge of GCSE Physics formulae. It is part of the Material Revision project.

Equator uses:

* [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite)
* [Material Design Icons](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign)

## Progress

Equator is very much a WIP and isn't really usable yet. Currently, Equator can:

* Generate and offer questions involving the formula velocity = distance ÷ time
* Accept user input for these questions and mark them correct/incorrect
* Look fancy (drop shadows make everything better)

## Soon™

Currently working on making Equator able to:

* Show the correct answer to the questions when you get them wrong
* Use multiple equations
* Allow the user to select an area of the syllabus from which to test equations
